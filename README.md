# Job_Site_Data_Analysis

In this project we got data from a job hunting webiste "Naukri.com" which was provided by Shan Singh in csv format. We created 2 jupyter notebooks namely:

1. Feature Engineering (Naukri.com) - Contains code for feature engineering we did on columns like "PayRate", "Experience" and "JobLocation" and ceated relevant new columns using them
2. Data Analyis (Naukri.com) - Contains code for various types of analysis performed on the modified data from 1st code. In this code we peformed following :
     1. Read CSV data and performed descriptive analysis on this
     2. Find out object type and numerical columns
     4. Uni-variate analysis - Group by a numerical feature based on a category and represent data using charts like Bar chart and pie 			 			chart
     5. Bi-variate analysis - Find out correlation between 2 numerical features using heatmap, box plot, strip plot
     6. Create functions for these analysis to call them any columns to automate the process
